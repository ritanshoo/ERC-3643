# Understanding Token Transfer

Here we explore the tokenTransfer.test.js file to understand the flow of things in our protocol.

#### Step 1- Defining roles

```
  const tokeny = accounts[0];
  const claimIssuer = accounts[1];
  const user1 = accounts[2];
  const user2 = accounts[3];
```

We defined the various roles in our ecosystem. Tokeny here is the company that issues tokens. We defined a claim issuer who tokeny trusts to sign claims for its investors. Lastly, we defined 2 users who will be the investing in tokeny and owning the security tokens.

#### Step 2- Tokeny deploys the token contract

```
  claimTopicsRegistry = await ClaimTopicsRegistry.new({ from: tokeny });
  trustedIssuersRegistry = await TrustedIssuersRegistry.new({ from: tokeny });
  identityRegistry = await IdentityRegistry.new(trustedIssuersRegistry.address, claimTopicRegistry.address, { from: tokeny });
  token = await Token.new(identityRegistry.address, { from: tokeny });
```

Tokeny deploys the claim topics registry and the trusted issuers registry. It then deploys the identity registry with addresses of claimTopicsRegistry and trustedIssuersRegistry as constructor parameters(it also can be set later). Lastly, Tokeny deploys the token with the address of identity registry as constructor parameter. Now the shares of Tokeny are up in the blockchain.

#### Step 3- Tokeny adds a trusted claim topic to claimTopics registry

```
  await claimTopicsRegistry.addClaimTopic(7, { from: tokeny }).should.be.fulfilled;
```

Tokeny adds a trusted claim topic by calling the addClaimTopic() function in the claimTopicsRegistry contract. It passes claimTopic 7 as the parameter. 7 is the claimTopic number for KYC check.


#### Step 4- Claim issuer deploys an identity contract

```
  claimIssuerContract = await ClaimHolder.new({ from: claimIssuer });
```

#### Step 5- Claim issuer adds a claim signer key to its identity contract

```
  let signerKey = bufferToHex(keccak256(abi.rawEncode(['address'], [accounts[5]])));
  // or web3.utils.keccak256(web3.eth.abi.encodeParameters(['address'], [accounts[5]]));
  await claimIssuerContract.addKey(signerKey, 3, 1, { from: claimIssuer }).should.be.fulfilled;
```

First an address is taken at random and it is converted to bytes. Then the claim Issuer adds this key to its identity contract by calling the addKey() function. In parameters, it passes the key, the purpose(3 = claim signer key) and the key type.


#### Step 6- Tokeny adds the claim issuer's identity contract in the trusted issuers registry

```
  await trustedIssuersRegistry.addTrustedIssuer(claimIssuerContract.address, 1, { from: tokeny })
```

In the previous steps, the claim issuer deployed its identity contract and added a claim signer key that will sign claims of investors. Now Tokeny trusts this claim issuer. So it adds the claim issuer's identity contract in the trusted issuers registry. All the investors in tokeny now need to have their claims signed by the above claim issuer.

#### Step 7- Investors(users) deploy their identity contracts

```
  //user1 deploys his identity contract
  user1Contract = await ClaimHolder.new({ from: user1 });

  //user2 deploys his identity contract
  user2Contract = await ClaimHolder.new({ from: user2 });
```

#### Step 8- Tokeny adds these identities to the identity registry

```
  await identityRegistry.registerIdentity(user1, user1Contract.address, { from: tokeny });
  await identityRegistry.registerIdentity(user2, user2Contract.address, { from: tokeny });
```

Tokeny adds the investor's identity contracts in the identity registry by calling the registerIdentity function of the identity registry contract.

#### Step 9- The claim issuer verifies user 1 

An off chain KYC check is done for user1 by the claim Issuer.

#### Step 10- The claim issuer signs the claim requested by the user

```
  //user1 gets signature from claim issuer
  let hexedData1 = await web3.utils.asciiToHex("Yea no, this guy is totes legit");
  let hashedDataToSign1 = await web3.utils.soliditySha3(
    user1Contract.address, //identity contract address
    7, //ClaimType
    hexedData1,
  );

  let signature1 = await web3.eth.sign(hashedDataToSign1, accounts[5]);
```

When the off-chain KYC check is a success, the claim Issuer signs a message with it's claim signer key.

#### Step 11- The claim is added in the user's identity contract

```
  await user1Contract.addClaim(7, 1, claimIssuerContract.address, signature1, hexedData1, "", { from: user1 });
```

After getting the signature from the claim issuer, the user adds this signed claim to his/her identity contract by calling the addClaim() function. 

#### Step 12- User 2 goes through the same process and adds the signed claim to his/her identity contract.

```
  //user2 gets signature from claim issuer
  let hexedData2 = await web3.utils.asciiToHex("Yea no, this guy is totes legit");
  let hashedDataToSign2 = await web3.utils.soliditySha3(
    user2Contract.address, //identity contract address
    7, //ClaimType
    hexedData2,
  );

  let signature2 = await web3.eth.sign(hashedDataToSign2, accounts[5]);

  //user2 adds claim to identity contract
  await user2Contract.addClaim(7, 1, claimIssuerContract.address, signature2, hexedData2, "", { from: user2 });
```

#### Step 13- Tokeny mints a 1000 tokens to user 1

```
  await token.mint(user1, 1000);
```

Since, user1 is a regulated investor according KYC check (user1 has the right claims in his/her identity contract), this should be a success.

#### Step 14- User1 tries to transfer 300 tokens to user 2

```
  await token.transfer(user2, 300, { from: user1 });
```

Since both user1 and user2 are regulated investors according to KYC check (they have the right claims in their identity contracts), the transfer of tokens should be a success.

```
  user1 balance: 700
  user2 balance: 300
    âœ“ Successful Token transfer (176ms)
```

So, the compliant transfer of tokens is a success. These identites of investors will not be limited to just Tokeny's security tokens. It can be extended to all kind of securities.
